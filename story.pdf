There lived a little girl name Pam in a far away village. She was the only daughter born to parents, John and Mary.
One morning John woke up with a serious headache whiles Mary was away working to provide for the family. Pam had to miss school to take care of her father. 
This put her in trouble with her school officials because she forgot to give a notice for her absence as she was supposed to take part in acompetition that day. She was expelled from school and lost her scholarship. 
Not knowing what to do since there was no money to enroll in another school, she decided to start selling fruits to help out her family.
One fine afternoon as she wAas going about her normal duty of selling some freshly plucked mangoes, a weell-to-do woman approached her to buy some mangoes.
The woman was impressed with how good Pam was good at calculatuions. She asked her what she was doing on the streets instead of being in a classroom. Pam narrated what had happened the past month to the woman, winning over her sympathy.
The woman quickly took Pam to see her parents and promised to take care of her. Pam went to the beszt schools and graduated top of all her classes. She became a medical doctor and built a hospital in her village to provide free healthcare for her people.
